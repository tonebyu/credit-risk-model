Credit Scoring Business Understanding
1. Basel II Accord and the Importance of Interpretability
The Basel II Accord emphasizes the need for quantitative risk measurement and requires banks to use internal rating-based (IRB) approaches to assess credit risk. This regulatory framework prioritizes transparency, auditable processes, and documented model governance. As a result, our credit scoring model must be not only predictive but also interpretable and traceable, enabling risk managers and auditors to understand how inputs translate into risk classifications. This is especially critical in high-stakes financial decisions where the justification of credit decisions must be clearly communicated to regulators and stakeholders.

2. Need for a Proxy Variable in Absence of Default Labels
In this project, we lack a direct label for customer "default." To proceed with model development, we must create a proxy variableâ€”often based on behavioral patterns such as low purchase frequency, late payments, or decreased monetary value (RFM). This proxy enables supervised learning but introduces business risks: if the proxy poorly represents actual defaults, the model may misclassify low-risk customers as high-risk, or vice versa. Such errors can lead to missed lending opportunities, increased default rates, or regulatory scrutiny due to biased or inaccurate credit assessments.

3. Model Choice: Interpretability vs. Performance
In regulated financial environments, model selection involves a trade-off:

Simple, interpretable models like Logistic Regression with Weight of Evidence (WoE) allow for clear explanations, regulatory approval, and stable performance, but may not capture complex non-linear patterns.

Complex models like Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) often deliver higher predictive performance but risk being opaque, harder to validate, and less accepted by regulators without model explainability tools (e.g., SHAP).
Thus, institutions often favor interpretable models in production, using complex models in parallel for challenger testing or score enhancement, balancing compliance, trust, and accuracy.
